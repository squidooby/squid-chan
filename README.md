# squid-chan
squid-chan is a discord bot created for me and by me
I am still working on it.
It is in python, I will (maybe in a few years)(lol) change it to a better language for it, like JS or TS (java script or typescript) I have never used TS, but a friend when I was working on a old bot told me about it.
## Commands
hello, about, ping, squidchan, uwu, truth, uptime, botsay, userinfo, get(secret), kos, ask, asnwer, avatar, and help
### How to get it?
you can't, I will make it public maybe in teh future.
